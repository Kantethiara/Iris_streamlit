## Overview

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning. It includes measurements of various features of iris flowers and their corresponding species. This project offers an interactive platform where users can explore the dataset, visualize the data, train machine learning models, and make predictions.

### Live Demo

Check out the live demo of the app [here](https://kantethiara-iris-streamlit-app-isgxmg.streamlit.app).

## Features

- **Data Exploration**: Explore the Iris dataset through interactive visualizations.
- **Model Training**: Train machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
- **Model Evaluation**: View the accuracy and feature importance of each model.
- **Prediction**: Make predictions using the trained models with custom input data.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is the famous **Iris** dataset, which contains 150 samples of iris flowers with the following features:

- **Sepal length**
- **Sepal width**
- **Petal length**
- **Petal width**

Each sample is labeled with one of three species:
- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor**
- **Virginica**

## Application

The application is built using **Streamlit**, a Python library that allows for the creation of interactive web applications with ease.

### Pages in the Application

1. **Home**: Introduction to the Iris dataset.
2. **Data Exploration**: Visualize the dataset with interactive plots.
3. **Modeling**: Train and evaluate different machine learning models.
4. **Prediction**: Make predictions using trained models with custom inputs.

## Setup

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kantethiara/Iris_streamlit
   cd iris_streamlit
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can navigate through the different pages using the sidebar. Explore the dataset, train models, and make predictions interactively.

## Deployment
